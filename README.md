## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Daniel

I'm a petroleoum engineer who is passionate for technology, professional development, building community and sports. Some technologies I enjoy working include R, Python, Power BI, Spotfire and Tableu. I have worked developing models to simulate and optimize the oil production process with the digital data gathered on field, making interactive dashboards to analyze the data and make better decissions.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as interpreter engineer for production logging.
- ðŸŒ± Now, I'm improving my skills as a Data Analyst. I'm part of the Platzi Master Pogram.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want. I'm interested in helping and sharing.
